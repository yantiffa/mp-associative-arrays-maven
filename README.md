Associative Arrays
==================
Author: Tiffany Yan

This is my miniproject assignment for CSC207 class, where I would build my first data structure. Along the way, I will practice with generics/parametric polymorphism. 

I have wrote three tests cases for methods in the AssociateArray class. 
I have also implemented AsscoiatedArray.java, and passed all the written test cases by the classes (Last runned the test case on 9/29/2024)
